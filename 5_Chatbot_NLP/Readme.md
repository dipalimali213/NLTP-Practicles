# 📚 Document Q&A System Using Streamlit, FAISS, and HuggingFace Embeddings

This project is a **Q&A System** built with `Streamlit` that processes PDF documents and pre-trained models to answer user queries. It uses `FAISS` to create a vector store from document embeddings generated by `HuggingFace Embeddings`, enabling efficient similarity-based search and contextual responses.

## 🚀 **Features**
✅ **Upload and Process PDF:** Convert a PDF document into vector embeddings using HuggingFace's `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model and save it as a `.pkl` file.  
✅ **Load Pre-trained PKL Model:** Load an existing vector store model to quickly start querying.  
✅ **Ask Questions from Document:** Enter a query and get answers based on the most relevant content extracted from the document.  
✅ **Vector Store Creation and Storage:** Automatically save and load vector stores as `.pkl` files for future use.

## 🎯 **Project Objective**
This project allows users to create a **knowledge base** from PDF documents or load an existing model to efficiently answer questions by performing a similarity search on the document content.

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack**
- **Frontend:** Streamlit
- **Backend:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - `streamlit` – To build the user interface.
  - `langchain_community` – For PDF document loading and text splitting.
  - `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` – To generate embeddings.
  - `FAISS` – For efficient vector-based similarity search.
  - `pickle` – For saving and loading vector stores.
  - `tempfile` – To handle temporary file storage.
  - `dotenv` – To manage environment variables.

## 📚 **How It Works**
### 1. **Upload and Process PDF**
- Upload a PDF document using the sidebar.
- The document is split into smaller chunks using `CharacterTextSplitter`.
- The chunks are transformed into vector embeddings using `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` with the model `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.
- The vector embeddings are stored in a `FAISS` index.
- The vector store is saved as a `.pkl` file for future use.

### 2. **Load Pre-trained PKL Model**
- Upload a previously generated `.pkl` file.
- Load the vector store and start asking questions instantly.

### 3. **Ask Questions**
- Enter a question in the text box.
- The system performs a **similarity search** to identify the most relevant chunks from the document.
- The system returns an answer based on the context extracted from the document.
