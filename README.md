# 📝 Natural Language Text Processing (NLTP) Practical

## 📌 Subject Overview
Natural Language Text Processing (NLTP) is a fascinating field in Artificial Intelligence that enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language. This subject covers essential techniques such as text preprocessing, language modeling, sentiment analysis, and chatbot development, empowering students with the skills required for real-world NLP applications.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, students will:
✅ Master text preprocessing techniques (Tokenization, Stop-word Removal, Stemming, Lemmatization)  
✅ Implement NLP-based classification models like spam filters and fake news detectors  
✅ Develop real-world applications such as sentiment analysis and chatbots  
✅ Gain hands-on experience in information retrieval and question-answering systems  
✅ Explore deep learning approaches like LSTMs in NLP  

## 📖 Topics Covered
- **Fundamentals of NLP**: Understanding human language processing
- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, Lemmatization, Stemming, Stop-word Removal
- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning in NLP**: HMM, LSTM, and more
- **Sentiment Analysis & Spam Classification**
