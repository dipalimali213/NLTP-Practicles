# üìù Text Preprocessing Tool Using Streamlit and NLTK

This project is a **web-based Text Preprocessing Tool** built with `Streamlit` that allows you to upload a CSV file and preprocess text data using the `Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)`. The tool performs **Tokenization, Stopword Removal, Stemming, and Lemmatization** on text data and provides a downloadable processed CSV file.

## üöÄ **Features**
‚úÖ Upload a CSV file containing text data.  
‚úÖ Select the desired text column to preprocess.  
‚úÖ Perform the following NLP operations:
- **Tokenization:** Splitting text into words.
- **Stopword Removal:** Removing common words that do not add significant meaning.
- **Stemming:** Reducing words to their base form.
- **Lemmatization:** Converting words to their root form.  
‚úÖ Preview the processed data in tabular format.  
‚úÖ Download the processed CSV file.

## üìö **How It Works**
1. **Upload CSV File:**  
   Upload a CSV file containing text data. The application reads the file and provides an option to select the text column to be processed.

2. **Select Text Column:**  
   Choose the text column from the dropdown menu that contains the data to be preprocessed.

3. **Text Preprocessing:**  
   Upon clicking the "Process Text" button, the following tasks are performed:
   - Tokenization
   - Stopword Removal
   - Stemming
   - Lemmatization  

4. **Download Processed Data:**  
   The processed data is displayed as a preview, and you can download it as a CSV file.
